Repository containing the material produced (homeworks and final project) during the master course of Interactive Graphics, Sapienza University of Rome, academic year 2019/2020. 

## Disclaimer
The code here is outdated, neither well structured nor well commented; it would be possible to make many adjustments and optimisations (which were not the aim of the course). Maybe I will make some changes in the future.
